# Asteroids Engine

The Asteroids engine is a C++ 2D engine.

Features:
  * Simplistic Networking interface (with automatic syncing of entities and components, and is quite resilient to lag)
  * Networked components and entities
  * Networked 2D physics
  * GUI system (powered by TGUI)
  * Window and audio system (powered by SFML)
  * Logging and error handling system

The engine is named after where it originated from, the game Asteroids. 
_**Documentation is a work in progress,**_ but most of the code is self-explanatory.
  
## Libraries

There are many libraries that the asteroids engine uses:
  * bitsery: For serialization and deserialization of networking messages
  * flecs: Entity-Component-System handling
  * GameNetworkingSockets: Steam's networking library, used for of course networking
  * SFML: Audio, Window, Rendering handling
  * TGUI: GUI handling
  * THST: Spatial partitioning library
